                        <p>For travelers to Patagonia, Torres del Paine is the cream of the crop. Located on the
                            Chilean
                            side of
                            Patagonia, this other-worldy national park features one of the top treks in the
                            world, the “W”
                            trek. </p>
                        <p>On this hike you’ll see the famous “postcard shots” of icy blue glaciers and lagoons.
                            Doing the W
                            trek with a guided tour is highly recommended for safety as well as unique insights
                            and
                            locations
