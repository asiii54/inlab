                        <p>Yellowstone stands out for being the oldest national park in the United States, founded in
                            1872. The
                            park is well known for geysers, the most famous being Old Faithful which erupts every
                            hour. </p>
                        <p>The geothermal activity in the park is what draws many visitors eager to see the steaming
                            pools and
                            springs. If you have a strong aversion to the smell of rotten eggs, beware. The hot springs
                            create a
                            very strong and pungent aroma!</p>
                        <p>The wildlife in Yellowstone is another highlight. Get ready to observe herds of buffalo and
                            meandering grizzly bears. Bird watching is also popular.</p>
