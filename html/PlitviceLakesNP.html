                        <p>Plitvice in Croatia is as close to a fairyland as anywhere in the world. The park
                            consists of
                            hundreds of waterfalls surrounding idyllic lakes and pools. Connecting them are
                            miles of wooden
                            pathways and hiking trails, providing unique views at eye level with the falls as
                            well as
                            expansive
                            vistas.</p>

                        <p>Within the boundaries of this heavily forested national park, 16 crystalline lakes
                            tumble into
                            each
                            other via a series of waterfalls and cascades. The mineral-rich waters carve through
                            the rock,
                            depositing tufa in continually changing formations. Clouds of butterflies drift
                            above the 18km
                            of
                            wooden footbridges and pathways that snake around the edges and across the rumbling
                            water.</p>
                        <p>It takes upwards of six hours to explore the lakes on foot, or you can slice two
                            hours off by
                            taking
                            advantage of the park's free boats and buses (departing every 30 minutes from April
                            to October).
                            From Entrance 2, catch the bus to the top of the upper lakes and wander back down to
                            the shore
                            of
                            4km-long Kozjak, the park's largest lake. A boat will whisk you from here to the
                            lower lakes,
                            where
                            the circuit culminates in the aptly named Veliki Slap, the tallest waterfall in
                            Croatia (78m).
                            The
                            path then climbs steeply (offering great views and photo opportunities) to a bus
                            stop, where you
                            can
                            grab a lift back to Entrance 2.</p>
                        <p>If you've got limited time, the upper lake section can be completed in two hours. The
                            lower
                            section
                            takes about three, although it's best to start with the bus ride and end with the
                            boat to save
                            yourself a climb.</p>
